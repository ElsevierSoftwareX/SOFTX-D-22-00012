(Summarize the new feature to be developed. For implementing bigger/broader features, 
a direction issue could be created instead.)

### Implementation plan

(Describe the implementation details. The plan should define, for example, 
the name of the new classes/methods to implement and their position in the library. 
It should also define what the new procedures to implement should do, 
e.g. in terms of input/output for new methods. Include code snippets if applicable.
Use code blocks (```) to make snippets properly readable.)
